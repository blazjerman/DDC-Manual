## Detailed Overview

The clock includes many LED indicators to show how the system works (details about LED functions are provided below). The indicator LEDs operate at low current to increase their lifespanâ€”most run at 2â€¯mA, except for the display LEDs, which are driven at around 15â€¯mA due to multiplexing and their lower brightness.

All other components on the board are high quality. All ceramic capacitors are C0G type from Murata Electronics, and the transistors and diodes are sourced from ON Semiconductor.

The clock board is divided into different chambers, each labeled by name and representing a specific functional section. There are five labeled chambers:

- Power Supply  
- Seconds  
- Hours / Minutes  
- Decoder  
- Multiplexer

Below is a detailed description of each chamber.

The power supply takes mains AC and converts it to a lower 6V using a transformer. A fuse is included on the primary side for safety. If a socket transformer is used, you should install a 1A fuse and short transformer pins 1 to 7 and 5 to 9. This allows you to connect the low-voltage wires from the socket to the top-right connector.

The transformer output is then rectified and regulated down to 6V using a low-voltage drop-down regulator. This regulator includes a comparator that compares a reference voltage from a 3V Zener diode to control the output. A BD140 transistor is used for voltage regulation. This transistor is rated to dissipate 1.25W without a heat sink; while a heat sink can be added, it is not required in this case.

On the right side, there is a Schmitt trigger comparator that receives the mains frequency signal and filters out unwanted noise that may come from other devices on the same power network. There is also an LED indicator labeled R296 (marked "CS" on the board), which blinks at the mains frequency.
